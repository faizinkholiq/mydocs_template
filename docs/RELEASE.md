## Release Types

**[Project Name]** follows semantic versioning with three main types of releases:

1. **Major Releases (X.0.0)**: Introduce significant new features, changes, or potentially breaking changes.
2. **Minor Releases (X.Y.0)**: Add new features, deprecate old features, and make non-breaking changes.
3. **Patch Releases (X.Y.Z)**: Include bug fixes, minor improvements, and documentation updates.

## Pre-Release Checklist

Before creating a new release, ensure the following tasks are completed:

- [ ] All code changes are merged into the `main` or `master` branch.
- [ ] All automated tests have passed.
- [ ] Code coverage is acceptable and meets project standards.
- [ ] All relevant documentation is updated (e.g., README.md, CHANGELOG.md, API documentation).
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date.
- [ ] No high-severity issues or bugs are open.

## Creating a Release

1. **Branching Strategy**:
   - For major or minor releases, create a new branch named `release-X.Y.0` from `main` or `master`.
   - For patch releases, use the existing branch and increment the patch version.

2. **Update Version Number**:
   - Update the version number in relevant files (e.g., `package.json`, `VERSION`, or similar).

3. **Update the Changelog**:
   - Add a new section to `CHANGELOG.md` with the new version number, date, and summary of changes.
   - Follow the format: `[Unreleased]` to `[X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`.

## Versioning

**[Project Name]** follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/). The version number should be in the format `X.Y.Z`, where:

- **X** (Major): Breaking changes.
- **Y** (Minor): New features, no breaking changes.
- **Z** (Patch): Bug fixes, no breaking changes.

## Testing and Quality Assurance

- Run the full test suite using the command `make test` (or equivalent).
- Ensure the test suite passes with 100% success.
- Conduct manual testing for major features and user-facing components.
- Perform cross-browser, cross-platform, or cross-device testing if applicable.
- Confirm that all critical and high-severity bugs are resolved.

## Publishing the Release

1. **Tagging the Release**:
   - Create a new Git tag for the release: `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release X.Y.Z"`
   - Push the tag to the repository: `git push origin vX.Y.Z`

2. **Build and Package the Release**:
   - Build the project: `make build` (or equivalent command).
   - Package the binaries, libraries, or distributable files.

3. **Create a Release on GitHub/GitLab**:
   - Go to the "Releases" section in your GitHub/GitLab repository.
   - Click "Draft a new release" and fill in the release notes, tag version, and attach build artifacts if needed.
   - Click "Publish Release."

4. **Notify the Community**:
   - Announce the new release on the project's communication channels (e.g., mailing list, Slack, Discord, Twitter).

## Post-Release Steps

- Monitor error logs, issues, and feedback for any critical bugs.
- Update project documentation with any changes or enhancements made in the release.
- Ensure all dependent repositories or projects are notified of the new release.
- Increment the `-dev` version in `main` or `master` to begin work on the next release.

## Rollback Procedures

In case a release needs to be rolled back:

1. **Revert the Changes**:
   - Create a new branch from the last stable release: `git checkout -b revert-to-vX.Y.(Z-1)`
   - Revert all commits after the last stable release: `git revert [commit-hash]`

2. **Test the Rollback**:
   - Run the full test suite to confirm that the rollback is stable and functional.

3. **Create a Patch Release**:
   - Follow the [Creating a Release](#creating-a-release) section to publish a patch release.
