# ADR <Number>: <Title>

## Status

- Proposed
- Accepted
- Deprecated
- Superseded by [ADR number]

## Context

Explain the situation or problem that prompted this decision. This section should describe:

- The architectural or technical issue that needs to be addressed.
- Any constraints, requirements, or assumptions.
- The impact of not making a decision at this time.

For example:

The current system does not have a caching layer, which results in slow response times for frequently accessed data. Introducing a caching layer could improve performance, but we need to decide which caching strategy and technology to use.

## Decision

State the decision that has been made. This section should be as concise as possible while still providing enough detail to understand what was decided.

For example:

We will use Redis as the caching layer for our application. Redis will be deployed as a managed service in our cloud environment. We will use a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache eviction policy with a maximum cache size of 512MB.

## Rationale

Explain why this decision was made. This section should provide:

- The reasoning behind the decision.
- Alternative options that were considered.
- Pros and cons of the chosen option compared to the alternatives.
- Why the chosen option is the best fit for the problem and context.

For example:

We chose Redis because it is a mature, well-supported caching solution with a strong community. It provides high performance, supports various eviction policies, and integrates well with our existing infrastructure. Other alternatives, such as Memcached, were considered but ultimately not chosen due to limited feature sets and lack of persistence support.

## Consequences

Describe the consequences of the decision. This includes:

- Positive and negative effects.
- Risks and how they will be mitigated.
- Any future actions that need to be taken.

For example:

- **Positive**: Improved response times for frequently accessed data.
- **Negative**: Additional operational complexity in managing Redis instances.
- **Risks**: Potential data inconsistency between cache and database; mitigated by setting appropriate cache expiration times and implementing cache invalidation strategies.
- **Future Actions**: Monitor cache hit/miss ratios and optimize cache size and eviction policy as needed.
