## High-Level Architecture

![High-Level Architecture Diagram](./docs/architecture-diagram.png)

The architecture of **[Project Name]** is based on a **[design pattern or architectural style, e.g., microservices, layered architecture, MVC, etc.]**. It consists of the following primary components:

- **Component 1**: Description of the component and its role.
- **Component 2**: Description of the component and its role.
- **Component 3**: Description of the component and its role.

## Modules and Components

### Module 1: [Module Name]

- **Description**: Explain the purpose of this module and its responsibilities.
- **Key Classes/Files**: List the important classes or files in this module.
- **Interaction with Other Modules**: Describe how this module interacts with other parts of the system.

### Module 2: [Module Name]

- **Description**: Explain the purpose of this module and its responsibilities.
- **Key Classes/Files**: List the important classes or files in this module.
- **Interaction with Other Modules**: Describe how this module interacts with other parts of the system.

*Repeat for additional modules or components.*

## Data Flow and State Management

The data flow in **[Project Name]** follows the **[e.g., event-driven, request-response, pub/sub, etc.]** pattern. Here's an overview of how data moves through the system:

1. **Data Source**: Describe where the data originates.
2. **Processing Layer**: Explain the data processing steps.
3. **Storage Layer**: Mention how and where data is stored.
4. **Presentation Layer**: Explain how data is presented to users or other systems.

## Key Design Decisions

List and explain any significant architectural or design decisions made during the development of the system. This may include decisions related to technology choices, patterns, libraries, frameworks, etc.

### 1. Decision 1

- **Context**: What was the context or problem being addressed?
- **Decision**: What decision was made?
- **Rationale**: Why was this decision made?
- **Consequences**: What are the trade-offs or implications of this decision?

### 2. Decision 2

*Continue for each key design decision.*

## Technology Stack

List the technologies, frameworks, libraries, and tools used in the architecture, along with their versions and purposes.

| Technology     | Version | Purpose                          |
| -------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------|
| Go             | 1.18    | Backend development               |
| Fiber          | 2.x     | Web framework                     |
| PostgreSQL     | 13      | Database                          |
| Redis          | 6.x     | Caching and session management    |
| Docker         | 20.x    | Containerization                  |

## Deployment Strategy

The application is deployed using **[e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, cloud services like AWS/GCP/Azure, etc.]**. The deployment architecture is composed of the following environments:

- **Development Environment**: Describe the environment setup and purpose.
- **Staging Environment**: Describe the environment setup and purpose.
- **Production Environment**: Describe the environment setup and purpose.

## Security Considerations

Describe the key security considerations and measures taken to secure the system. This may include authentication, authorization, data encryption, network security, etc.

## Performance Considerations

Outline any performance optimizations implemented in the architecture. This may include caching strategies, database indexing, asynchronous processing, etc.

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements to the architecture may include:

- **Scalability Improvements**: Describe planned improvements for handling more load.
- **Refactoring**: Mention any parts of the system that could be refactored for better performance or maintainability.
- **New Features**: List any planned new features that could affect the architecture.
