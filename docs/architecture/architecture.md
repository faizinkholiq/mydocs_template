## High-Level Architecture

![High-Level Architecture Diagram](./docs/architecture-diagram.png)

The architecture of **[Project Name]** is based on a **[design pattern or architectural style, e.g., microservices, layered architecture, MVC, etc.]**. It consists of the following primary components:

- **Component 1**: Description of the component and its role.
- **Component 2**: Description of the component and its role.
- **Component 3**: Description of the component and its role.

## Modules and Components

### Module 1: [Module Name]

- **Description**: Explain the purpose of this module and its responsibilities.
- **Key Classes/Files**: List the important classes or files in this module.
- **Interaction with Other Modules**: Describe how this module interacts with other parts of the system.

### Module 2: [Module Name]

- **Description**: Explain the purpose of this module and its responsibilities.
- **Key Classes/Files**: List the important classes or files in this module.
- **Interaction with Other Modules**: Describe how this module interacts with other parts of the system.

*Repeat for additional modules or components.*

## Data Flow and State Management

The data flow in **[Project Name]** follows the **[e.g., event-driven, request-response, pub/sub, etc.]** pattern. Here's an overview of how data moves through the system:

1. **Data Source**: Describe where the data originates.
2. **Processing Layer**: Explain the data processing steps.
3. **Storage Layer**: Mention how and where data is stored.
4. **Presentation Layer**: Explain how data is presented to users or other systems.

## External Dependencies

**[Project Name]** relies on the following external libraries, frameworks, and services:

- **Library/Framework 1**: Brief description of its use and version.
- **Service 1**: Brief description of its purpose and integration points.

*Repeat for additional dependencies.*

## Deployment Strategy

The application is deployed using **[e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, cloud services like AWS/GCP/Azure, etc.]**. The deployment architecture is composed of the following environments:

- **Development Environment**: Describe the environment setup and purpose.
- **Staging Environment**: Describe the environment setup and purpose.
- **Production Environment**: Describe the environment setup and purpose.

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements to the architecture may include:

- **Scalability Improvements**: Describe planned improvements for handling more load.
- **Refactoring**: Mention any parts of the system that could be refactored for better performance or maintainability.
- **New Features**: List any planned new features that could affect the architecture.
