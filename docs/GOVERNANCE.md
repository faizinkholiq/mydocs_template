## Decision-Making Process

The decision-making process in **[Project Name]** follows a consensus-based model. Major decisions, such as significant feature additions, architectural changes, or changes to the governance policy, require approval from the Maintainers.

**Types of Decisions:**

- **Minor Changes** (e.g., bug fixes, minor feature improvements): Approved by at least one Maintainer.
- **Major Changes** (e.g., breaking changes, major features): Requires a discussion among the Maintainers and at least 75% approval.
- **Governance Changes**: Requires unanimous approval from all Maintainers.

### Decision-Making Guidelines:

1. **Discussion**: All major decisions start with a discussion in the project's [discussion forum, GitHub Issues, Slack, etc.].
2. **Proposal**: A formal proposal is created in the form of a pull request or issue.
3. **Review**: Maintainers review the proposal and provide feedback.
4. **Approval**: If a consensus is reached, the decision is documented, and the changes are implemented.

## Proposal Process

To propose a change to the project, follow these steps:

1. **Create an Issue**: Start a discussion by creating a new issue in the [GitHub repository link].
2. **Draft a Proposal**: Once there is agreement to move forward, draft a detailed proposal outlining the changes, benefits, and potential impact.
3. **Submit a Pull Request**: Submit the proposal as a pull request, which will be reviewed by the Maintainers.
4. **Feedback and Iteration**: Engage with Maintainers and the community to address any feedback and iterate on the proposal.
5. **Final Decision**: The Maintainers will approve or reject the proposal based on the decision-making guidelines.

## Conflict Resolution

In the event of a disagreement or conflict within the project:

1. **Discussion**: All parties involved should engage in a respectful discussion to understand each other's viewpoints.
2. **Mediation**: If the conflict persists, a neutral Maintainer may act as a mediator to help resolve the issue.
3. **Final Decision**: If a resolution cannot be reached through discussion and mediation, the Maintainers will vote, and the majority decision will be final.

## Communication Channels

To stay informed and participate in project discussions, use the following communication channels:

- **GitHub Issues**: For bug reports, feature requests, and discussions.
- **Pull Requests**: For proposing changes to the project.
- **Mailing List/Slack/Discord**: For general discussions, announcements, and real-time communication.
- **Weekly/Monthly Meetings**: [Details if any regular meetings are held].

## Amendments

This governance policy is a living document and may be updated periodically. Changes to this document must be proposed via a pull request and require unanimous approval from the Maintainers.
