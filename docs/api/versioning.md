### Sample `versioning.md`

This file explains how API versioning is handled.

```markdown
# API Versioning

Our API uses versioning to ensure backward compatibility and to allow for the introduction of new features without disrupting existing clients.

## Versioning Scheme

We use a version number in the URL to indicate the version of the API being used. For example, `/api/v1/` indicates version 1 of the API.

## Upgrading

When a new version of the API is released, clients are encouraged to upgrade to the latest version. We will provide release notes and migration guides to assist with upgrading.

For example:

- **v1**: Initial version
- **v2**: Introduces new features and improvements

Please refer to the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for details on changes between versions.
