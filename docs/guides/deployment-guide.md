## Introduction

Provide an overview of the deployment process, including the purpose of the guide and what the reader will learn. Describe the deployment environments and their significance.

## Prerequisites

List the requirements needed before deploying the project. This may include:
- Access to deployment environments (servers, cloud services, etc.)
- Necessary tools and software (Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, etc.)
- Configuration files and secrets

## Deployment Environment Setup

### Development Environment

Provide instructions for setting up the development environment. Include:
- Required software and tools
- Configuration settings
- Example environment variables

```bash
# Example setup commands for development environment
export DATABASE_URL=dev_db_url
export API_KEY=dev_api_key
```

### Staging Environment

Outline the steps for configuring the staging environment, which should closely mirror the production environment. Include:

  - Configuration settings
  - Deployment procedures
  - Verification steps

### Production Environment

Detail the setup for the production environment, focusing on:

- Security considerations
- Performance optimizations
- Scaling and load balancing

## Deployment Process

### Manual Deployment

Describe the steps to deploy the project manually, including:

- Building the project
- Uploading files
- Running deployment scripts

```bash
# Example manual deployment commands
./build.sh
scp -r ./build user@prod_server:/path/to/deploy
ssh user@prod_server 'cd /path/to/deploy && ./deploy.sh'
```

### Automated Deployment

Provide instructions for setting up automated deployment using CI/CD tools or scripts. Include:

- CI/CD configuration files (e.g., .github/workflows, .gitlab-ci.yml)
- Deployment pipeline setup
- Integration with version control systems

```yaml
# Example CI/CD configuration (GitHub Actions)
name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Build and Deploy
      run: |
        ./build.sh
        ./deploy.sh
```

## Post-Deployment Steps

List the tasks to complete after deploying the project, such as:

- Verifying deployment success
- Running tests
- Monitoring logs and metrics
- Updating documentation

## Troubleshooting

Provide common issues and their solutions. Include:

- Error messages
- Debugging tips
- Contact information for support

## Additional Resources

Include links to relevant resources, such as:

- Project Documentation
- CI/CD Documentation
- Cloud Provider Guides
