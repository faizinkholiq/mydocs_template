## Introduction

This section provides a brief overview of the system and its integration capabilities. It explains the benefits of integrating with the system and any prerequisites needed to start the integration process.

## Authentication

Describe the authentication methods supported by your API. Common methods include:

- **API Key Authentication**: Explain how to obtain an API key and where to include it in requests.
- **OAuth 2.0**: Describe the OAuth flow, how to obtain access tokens, refresh tokens, and manage scopes.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Explain how JWT is used for secure access and what claims are required.

Provide examples of authentication headers:

```http
Authorization: Bearer {access_token}
```

## API Endpoints

### Base URL

Provide the base URL for API requests:

```
https://api.example.com/v1
```

### Endpoint Overview

List the key endpoints available for integration:

- GET /users: Retrieve a list of users.
- POST /users: Create a new user.
- PUT /users/{id}: Update an existing user.
- DELETE /users/{id}: Delete a user.

Refer to the [API Reference](api-reference.md) for detailed endpoint information.

## Data Formats

### Request Format

Explain the data formats used in requests, such as JSON, XML, or form-encoded data. Provide an example request payload:

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

### Response Format

Describe the structure of the API responses. Include an example response payload:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "id": 123,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com"
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

Explain how errors are communicated via the API. List common error codes and their meanings. Provide an example of an error response:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "error": {
    "code": "400_BAD_REQUEST",
    "message": "Invalid request parameters"
  }
}
```

Refer to the [Error Code Reference](error-codes.md) for more details.

## Rate Limiting and Throttling

Describe any rate limits or throttling mechanisms that are in place to prevent abuse. Provide details on how to handle rate limit errors and how to monitor usage.

## Webhooks

Explain how to set up and use webhooks to receive real-time notifications from the system. Include details on:

- **Webhook Setup**: How to register a webhook endpoint.
- **Payload Structure**: The format of webhook payloads.
- **Security**: How to verify the authenticity of webhook requests.

## SDKs and Libraries

List any official or community-supported SDKs or libraries that are available for integrating with your system. Include links to their repositories or documentation.

## Testing and Sandbox Environment

Provide details about the sandbox environment available for testing integrations without affecting the production data. Include information on how to access the sandbox, sandbox-specific credentials, and any limitations.

## Best Practices

Offer best practices for integrating with your system, including tips for handling rate limits, optimizing API usage, secure data handling, and maintaining compatibility with future updates.

## Troubleshooting

Provide a section on common issues and their solutions. This can include error messages, network issues, data format errors, or authentication problems.

## Support

Describe the available support channels for integration-related questions. This could include documentation links, community forums, or direct contact information for developer support.
