# Error Codes Reference

This document provides a detailed overview of the error codes used in the application. Error codes are used to indicate the type and reason for an error that occurs during the execution of an API call or any other operation.

## Introduction

This section introduces the purpose of error codes and explains how they help in debugging, monitoring, and handling errors in the application. Error codes are typically used in API responses and logs to indicate specific issues that occurred.

## Error Code Structure

Error codes are structured in a way to provide meaningful information. The format is typically:

`<HTTP_STATUS_CODE><MODULE><ERROR_NAME>`

- **HTTP_STATUS_CODE**: The standard HTTP status code (e.g., 400, 404, 500).
- **MODULE**: A short identifier for the module where the error occurred (e.g., `AUTH`, `USER`, `ORDER`).
- **ERROR_NAME**: A brief, descriptive name for the error (e.g., `INVALID_CREDENTIALS`, `USER_NOT_FOUND`).

For example: `400_AUTH_INVALID_CREDENTIALS`.

## Common Error Codes

### 4xx Client Errors

These errors indicate that there was a problem with the request sent by the client.

- **400_BAD_REQUEST**: The request could not be understood or was missing required parameters.
- **401_UNAUTHORIZED**: Authentication failed or user does not have the required permissions.
- **403_FORBIDDEN**: The authenticated user does not have access to the requested resource.
- **404_NOT_FOUND**: The requested resource could not be found.

### 5xx Server Errors

These errors indicate that there was a problem on the server.

- **500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR**: An unexpected error occurred on the server.
- **503_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE**: The server is currently unable to handle the request.

## Module-Specific Error Codes

### Authentication Errors

These errors are related to authentication failures.

- **401_AUTH_INVALID_CREDENTIALS**
  - **Description**: The provided credentials are incorrect.
  - **HTTP Status**: 401 Unauthorized
  - **Resolution**: Verify the username and password.

- **401_AUTH_TOKEN_EXPIRED**
  - **Description**: The authentication token has expired.
  - **HTTP Status**: 401 Unauthorized
  - **Resolution**: Re-authenticate to obtain a new token.

### User Management Errors

These errors are related to user management operations.

- **404_USER_NOT_FOUND**
  - **Description**: The specified user does not exist.
  - **HTTP Status**: 404 Not Found
  - **Resolution**: Verify the user ID and try again.

- **400_USER_EMAIL_ALREADY_EXISTS**
  - **Description**: The email address provided is already associated with another user.
  - **HTTP Status**: 400 Bad Request
  - **Resolution**: Use a different email address.

### Order Management Errors

These errors are related to order processing and management.

- **404_ORDER_NOT_FOUND**
  - **Description**: The specified order does not exist.
  - **HTTP Status**: 404 Not Found
  - **Resolution**: Verify the order ID and try again.

- **400_ORDER_INVALID_STATUS**
  - **Description**: The order status provided is invalid.
  - **HTTP Status**: 400 Bad Request
  - **Resolution**: Check the allowed order statuses and update accordingly.

## Best Practices

- **Use Standard HTTP Status Codes**: Always use standard HTTP status codes that correspond to the error condition.
- **Provide Meaningful Error Messages**: Ensure that the error messages are meaningful and provide enough context to understand the error.
- **Log Errors for Debugging**: Log errors with enough detail to facilitate debugging and troubleshooting.
- **Consistent Error Code Format**: Maintain a consistent error code format across all modules and services.
