## Introduction

We follow a structured versioning strategy to ensure consistency and predictability in our releases. This document describes the versioning scheme, release types, compatibility rules, and deprecation policies. It is designed to help developers, integrators, and end-users understand what to expect from each release.

## Versioning Scheme

We follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) as our versioning scheme. The version format is defined as:

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```

- **MAJOR** version: Increments when there are incompatible API changes.
- **MINOR** version: Increments when functionality is added in a backward-compatible manner.
- **PATCH** version: Increments when backward-compatible bug fixes are made.

### Major Versions

- Incremented when changes are made that break backward compatibility.
- These releases may introduce substantial new features, changes, or improvements.

### Minor Versions

- Incremented when new features or functionality are added in a backward-compatible way.
- Minor versions may also include bug fixes and performance improvements that do not break existing functionality.

### Patch Versions

- Incremented when bug fixes or small improvements are made that do not affect compatibility.
- Patches typically address security issues, bugs, and other minor improvements.

## Release Types

### Stable Releases

Stable releases are thoroughly tested and considered production-ready. They follow the version format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

### Pre-releases

Pre-releases are versions that are not yet ready for production and are marked with identifiers like `-alpha`, `-beta`, or `-rc` (release candidate). The format follows:

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-QUALIFIER
```

Examples:
- `1.0.0-alpha`
- `2.1.0-beta.1`
- `3.0.0-rc.2`

## Backward Compatibility

- **Major Versions**: Breaking changes may occur. Users may need to adjust their implementations when upgrading.
- **Minor Versions**: Should be fully backward-compatible with previous minor versions.
- **Patch Versions**: Should be fully backward-compatible with previous patch versions.

## Release Cycle

- **Major Releases**: Planned annually or as needed when significant changes occur.
- **Minor Releases**: Planned quarterly or as needed for adding new features.
- **Patch Releases**: Released as needed for bug fixes and minor improvements.

## Deprecation Policy

- Features and APIs marked as deprecated will remain available for at least one major release cycle.
- Deprecated features will be documented in the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) with recommended alternatives.

## Changelog Management

- All changes, including new features, bug fixes, and deprecations, will be documented in the `CHANGELOG.md` file.
- Each entry should include a short description of the change, its impact, and any migration instructions if applicable.

## Examples

- **Major Version Bump**: `2.0.0` -> `3.0.0`: Introduces breaking changes, such as API redesigns.
- **Minor Version Bump**: `2.1.0` -> `2.2.0`: Adds new features, such as additional API endpoints.
- **Patch Version Bump**: `2.2.1` -> `2.2.2`: Fixes a bug or resolves a minor security issue.
