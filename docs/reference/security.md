## Introduction

Security is a top priority for our system. This document provides guidelines to ensure the system is protected against unauthorized access, data breaches, and other potential threats. All team members and contributors must follow these guidelines to maintain the highest security standards.

## Authentication and Authorization

### User Authentication

- Use secure and proven authentication methods, such as OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, or JWT.
- Ensure that password policies enforce complexity, expiration, and reuse rules.
- Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) wherever possible.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- Assign roles and permissions based on the principle of least privilege.
- Use centralized access management systems to manage roles and permissions.

### API Authentication

- Use API keys, JWT tokens, or OAuth 2.0 for API authentication.
- Rotate API keys and tokens periodically and when a breach is suspected.

## Data Protection

### Data Encryption

- Use AES-256 or higher for data encryption at rest.
- Use TLS 1.2 or higher for data encryption in transit.
- Ensure that all sensitive data, such as passwords, are hashed using a secure algorithm like bcrypt.

### Data Storage Security

- Store sensitive data in encrypted databases or secure storage solutions.
- Use access control lists (ACLs) to restrict data access.

### Data Retention and Deletion

- Follow the principle of data minimization: only collect and retain data necessary for business purposes.
- Ensure that data is securely deleted when no longer needed.

## Network Security

### Transport Layer Security (TLS)

- Enforce TLS 1.2 or higher for all network communications.
- Regularly update and manage TLS certificates.

### Firewall Rules and Network Segmentation

- Implement firewalls to restrict access to critical network segments.
- Use Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) for secure remote access.

### Rate Limiting and Throttling

- Implement rate limiting and request throttling to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
- Use tools like API gateways and Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) for protection.

## Vulnerability Management

### Dependency Management

- Regularly update libraries and dependencies to their latest secure versions.
- Use tools like `Dependabot` or `Snyk` to automate vulnerability checks.

### Patch Management

- Apply security patches promptly for all software and systems.
- Maintain an inventory of all software and their patch status.

### Security Testing

- Perform regular security assessments, including penetration testing and vulnerability scanning.
- Use Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tools.

## Incident Response

### Monitoring and Logging

- Enable detailed logging for all critical systems and services.
- Use centralized logging solutions and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools.

### Incident Reporting

- Establish a clear incident reporting process for both internal and external stakeholders.
- Provide a dedicated email address or platform for security incident reports (e.g., `security@example.com`).

### Response Procedures

- Develop and maintain an incident response plan.
- Conduct regular incident response drills and reviews.

## Secure Development Practices

### Code Review and Static Analysis

- Enforce code reviews for all changes to the codebase.
- Use static analysis tools to identify security vulnerabilities.

### Input Validation and Output Encoding

- Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (SQL, XSS, etc.).
- Encode outputs to avoid injection attacks and data leakage.

### Secure Coding Guidelines

- Follow secure coding guidelines and industry best practices.
- Use secure libraries and frameworks for development.

## Compliance

### Data Privacy Regulations

- Comply with data privacy regulations such as GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, etc.
- Ensure that personal data is processed and stored securely.

### Industry Standards

- Follow industry standards such as OWASP Top Ten, NIST, and ISO 27001.
- Conduct regular security audits to ensure compliance.
