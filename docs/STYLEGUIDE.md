## General Principles

- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code.
- Prioritize simplicity and clarity over complexity.
- Consistently apply this style guide throughout the project.
- Adhere to the [language/framework standard guidelines] where applicable.

## Formatting

- **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces per indentation level. Do not use tabs.
- **Line Length**: Limit lines to a maximum of 80 characters.
- **Trailing Whitespace**: Remove any trailing whitespace at the end of lines.
- **Blank Lines**: Use blank lines to separate functions, classes, and logical blocks of code.
- **Braces**: Use braces for all control structures (`if`, `for`, `while`, etc.), even for single statements.
- **Spacing**: Place a single space after commas, colons, and semicolons. Avoid multiple spaces between tokens.

## Naming Conventions

- **Files and Directories**:
  - Use `snake_case` for file and directory names.
  - Directory names should be pluralized if they contain multiple entities (e.g., `controllers/`, `models/`).
- **Variables**:
  - Use `camelCase` for variable and function names (e.g., `userName`, `fetchData()`).
  - Use `PascalCase` for class names (e.g., `UserProfile`).
  - Constants should be in `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `MAX_RETRY_COUNT`).
- **Functions and Methods**:
  - Function and method names should be descriptive and use `camelCase`.
  - Method names should start with a verb (e.g., `getUserData()`, `validateInput()`).
- **Classes and Structs**:
  - Use `PascalCase` for classes and struct names.
  - Avoid abbreviations and acronyms unless they are widely accepted.

## Code Structure

- Organize code logically into modules or packages.
- Keep each file focused on a single responsibility.
- Avoid large files; break them down into smaller, more manageable pieces.
- Use a consistent order for class members: constants, fields, constructors, methods.

## Comments and Documentation

- Write meaningful comments to explain non-obvious code logic.
- Use [JSDoc/Doxygen/Docstrings] format for documenting functions, methods, classes, and modules.
- Keep comments up to date with code changes.
- Avoid redundant comments that state the obvious.

### Example:

```go
// FetchUserData retrieves user data from the database based on user ID.
func FetchUserData(userID int) (User, error) {
    ...
}
```

## Error Handling

- Handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages.
- Use exceptions (or error handling mechanisms in your language) judiciously.
- Avoid silent failures; always log unexpected errors.
- Ensure that the program fails safely when encountering an error.

## Testing

- Write tests for all new features and bug fixes.
- Follow the [Test-Driven Development (TDD)] approach whenever possible.
- Use descriptive names for test cases and functions.
- Group related test cases together and use a consistent test file naming convention (e.g., `test_[module_name].go`).

## Version Control Guidelines

- Commit messages should be concise but descriptive.
- Use the present tense (e.g., "Add feature X" instead of "Added feature X").
- Follow the convention: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>` (e.g., `fix(auth): correct login validation`).
- Squash trivial commits whenever possible to keep the commit history clean.
