# Integration Guide

Learn how to integrate our software with other services or systems.

## Integrating with Service X

To integrate with Service X, follow these steps:

1. **Obtain API credentials** from Service X.
2. **Configure your integration** in the `config/integration.json` file:

    ```json
    {
      "serviceX": {
        "apiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY",
        "endpoint": "https://api.servicex.com"
      }
    }
    ```

3. **Use the provided API endpoints** to interact with Service X:

    ```bash
    curl -X GET "https://api.servicex.com/resource?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```

## Webhooks

To receive real-time updates from Service Y, set up a webhook:

1. **Register your webhook URL** with Service Y.
2. **Implement a webhook handler** in your application:

    ```go
    func webhookHandler(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
        // Handle webhook data here
        return c.SendStatus(fiber.StatusOK)
    }
    ```

3. **Verify incoming requests** using the provided signature to ensure they come from Service Y.
